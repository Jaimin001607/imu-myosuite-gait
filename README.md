# imu-myosuite-gait
IMU/OpenSim gait data processing and MuJoCo (MyoSuite) playback. Extracts joint angles and velocities from .mot files and visualizes hip–knee–ankle locomotion with smooth, looped gait cycles.

## To actually Run the code files we would need the motion files locally saved and renamed to code files if not automatically.

## Setup
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
